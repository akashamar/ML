There are several steps you can take to start learning machine learning. Here are some suggestions:

Get familiar with basic mathematics concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, and statistics1.
Choose a programming language for ML development, such as Python or R1.
Familiarize yourself with the basics of the chosen programming language and its libraries for data analysis and visualization1.
Start with simple ML algorithms such as linear regression or K-nearest neighbors and implement them from scratch1.
Get your hands dirty with real-world datasets and work on projects to get practical experience1.
Participate in online communities, such as Kaggle, and contribute to open-source ML projects to expand your knowledge and network with others in the field1.
Stay updated with the latest research and advancements in ML by reading papers and attending conferences1.
